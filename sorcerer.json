In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.<br><b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level whenever the spell's level appears in the stat block."

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).<br> Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>. A <i>disintegrate</i> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. "
